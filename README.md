# my-keyestudio-project
Hi I am a 10 year old boy and I am experimenting with the keyestudio house ks5009.
See my projects and if you see any bugs please let me know.

These projects have been made by me for the original keyestudio examples : fs.keyestudio.com/KS5009

The first file you will find will be printhora.
It is a project made by me and what it does is to show the time on the screen.

The second program consists of the house with its sensor to measure the temperature and humidity.

The third program consists of a card with RFID  that makes a scene with all the things of the house.
